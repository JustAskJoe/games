Engine and bot sim only: nothing to play on screen yet.

### What's new
- **The rules work end to end.** Two teams of two take turns on a map of hills, a valley and caves. Walk a few steps, pick a weapon, set angle and power, and fire against the wind. Explosions carve the ground, knock units back and can drop them into the water.
- **Three weapons:** the Shell (unlimited), the Cluster (pops and throws five bomblets, 2 a match) and the **Live dud** (2 a match): it lands without exploding and ticks down for 3 turns. Anyone standing close enough can pick it up and lob it on. A blast next to a dud sets it off early, so chain reactions happen.
- **Every match ends:** from turn 24 the water rises a little every turn.
- **Bots** play whole matches for balance testing (smart, sloppy, a no-duds bot and a dud-happy bot). Results are in `design/handoff.md`.
- `build-and-test.py` runs 622 rule checks (replays, saves, refused moves, duds) and the balance sim against a proposed pass band. Full run: ALL GOOD.

### Next up
- [ ] @Louiemark: confirm or change the proposed pass band and the first-pass numbers in `design/handoff.md` (fuse 3 turns, lob range 5, 14 steps a turn, rising water from turn 24).
- [ ] The local hotseat screen: renderer, drag-to-aim, wind arrow, weapon picker, dud countdown, turn timer, win screen and rematch, best-of-3. Then `build.py`, `builds/wormsbound.html`, a Playwright test, and a `games.json` build entry.
- [ ] A Lead Artist plan (`art/lead-plan.md`) before any art is generated.

### Watch out
- [ ] **Live duds are only a small edge so far:** using them is worth about 4 points of win rate (smart beats nodud 54%), and a dud gets lobbed only 0.3 times a match. Probably the 3-turn fuse gives the target time to walk away. Not tuned yet; try fuse 2 or a bigger lob range once people have played it.
- [ ] Going first wins 56% of smart-vs-smart matches. Normal for the genre; alternating who starts in a best-of-3 should help.
- [ ] The sim is noisy at small sizes: the first-turn number read 45% at 60 matches and 56% at 200. Trust only the 200-match run.
- [ ] The bots aim with the game's own physics, so they're better shots than any person. The noise they add stands in for human aim; it isn't measured against real players.
- [ ] Bots never walk except to dodge a dud about to go off, so movement isn't balanced at all.
- [ ] The name "Wormsbound" joins two other studios' game names (Worms, GunBound). Pick an original title before anything public.
- [ ] Bomblets and terrain changes aren't in the bots' aim prediction, so bots underrate the Cluster a little.
- [ ] Not added to CI: `.github/workflows/checks.yml` only runs Tower Defense. Run `build-and-test.py` by hand before pushing.
